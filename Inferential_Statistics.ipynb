    "With the increasing prevalence of drug-abuse within the sport of horse racing, the Thoroughbred Horseracing Integrity Act of 2015 was introduced to monitor and regulate drug usage and administration to American race horses under a national uniform standard. Effective on January 1, 2017, the legislation authorizes the Thoroughbred Horseracing Anti-Doping Authority (THADA) to develop and administer a national anti-doping program.
